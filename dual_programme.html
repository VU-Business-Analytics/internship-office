		<h1>Dual programme Business Analytics</h1>
		
		<p>The dual Master's programme combines work and study. During this programme the student is employed part time, and studies part time. The work has to be relevant for the study. In addition, the student gets 12 credit points (cp) for the work time. The external graduation project Master Project Business Analytics can also be carried out at the same company. Most dual students choose this option. </p>
